1. The main script will be written in Python to ensure cross-platform compatibility.
2. Script must detect the OS type (Windows, Linux)
3. If Windows, use PowerShell commands; if Linux, use Bash commands
4. If Linux then run bash script and give options:
    a. Create a new user -> Done (Working - partially)
    b. Delete an existing user, After deleting the user if the user currently logged in then logout the user(Even if the user logged in) -> Done (Working - partially)
    c. Disable an existing user , After disable the user if the user currently logged in then logout the user -> Partially Done
    d. Enable an existing user -> Done (Working - partially)
    e. List all users -> Done (Working - partially)
    f. Give existing user admin rights -> Done (Working - partially)
    g. Remove admin rights from user -> Done (Working - partially)
    h. Change user password, After changing the user password if the user currently logged in then logout the user, password aging -> Done - Partially (Working - partially)
    i. Modify user groups -> Done (Working - partially)
    j. Check if a local group exists -> Pending
    Tested on CentOS 10
5. If Windows then run PowerShell script and give options:
    a. Create a new user
    b. Delete an existing user
    c. Disable an existing user
    d. Enable an existing user
    e. List all users
    f. Give existing user admin rights
    g. Remove admin rights from user
    h. Change user password
    i. Modify user groups
    j. Check if a local group exists
6. Extra features for both OS types:
   a. Error handling for invalid inputs(e.g. user does not exist, insufficient permissions)    
   b. While creating a user, it asks for set password automated or manually
      i. If automated, it asks for password length (minimum 8 characters) and generates a strong password and displays it.
      ii. If manually, it prompts for password input and validates its strength.
   c. Log all actions performed with timestamps to a log file for auditing purposes.
7. Ensure the script requires administrative privileges to run.
8. Provide clear instructions and prompts for user interaction.
