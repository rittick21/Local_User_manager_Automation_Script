1. The main script will be written in Python to ensure cross-platform compatibility.
2. Script must detect the OS type (Windows, Linux)
3. If Windows, use PowerShell commands; if Linux, use Bash commands
4. If Linux then run bash script and give options:
    a. Create a new user -> Done (Working - partially)
    b. Delete an existing user, After deleting the user if the user currently logged in then logout the user(Even if the user logged in) -> Done (Working)
    c. Disable an existing user , After disable the user if the user currently logged in then logout the user -> Done (Working)
    d. Enable an existing user -> Done (Working)
    e. List all users -> Done (Working)
    f. Give existing user admin rights -> Done (Working)
    g. Remove admin rights from user -> Done (Working)
    h. Change user password, After changing the user password if the user currently logged in then logout the user, password aging -> Done - Partially (Working)
    i. Modify user groups -> Done (Working)
    j. Check if a local group exists -> Done (Working)
    k. User account permissions management (e.g. chmod, chown) -> Pending
    l. User account expiration management -> Pending
    m. Group account permissions management -> Pending
    n. Logging user management activities to a file -> Done
    o. Log viewing and monitoring -> Done 
    p. Generate a mail format on terminal like this: -> Pending
       Subject: New user account creds on server [servername]
         Body: Hi [username],
               Your local account has been created on [servername].
               IP: [server_ip]
               Username: [username]
               Password: [password]
               You can take the ssh access using the above credentials using putty or MobaXterm.
    Tested on CentOS 10, Kali Linux
5. If Windows then run PowerShell script and give options:
    a. Create a new user -> Done (Working - partially)
    b. Delete an existing user, After deleting the user if the user currently logged in then logout the user(Even if the user logged in) -> Done (Working)
    c. Disable an existing user , After disable the user if the user currently logged in then logout the user -> Done (Working)
    d. Enable an existing user -> Done (Working)
    e. List all users -> Done (Working)
    f. Give existing user admin rights -> Done (Working)
    g. Remove admin rights from user -> Done (Working)
    h. Change user password, After changing the user password if the user currently logged in then logout the user, password aging -> Done - Partially (Working)
    i. Modify user groups -> Done (Working)
    j. Check if a local group exists -> Done (Working)
    k. User account permissions management -> Pending
    l. User account expiration management -> Pending
    m. Group account permissions management -> Pending
    n. Logging user management activities to a file -> Pending
    o. Log viewing and monitoring -> Done 
    p. Generate a mail format on terminal like this: -> Pending
       Subject: New user account creds on server [servername]
         Body: Hi [username],
               Your local account has been created on [servername].
               Username: [username]
               Password: [password]
               You can take the RDP access using the above credentials.
    Tested on Windows Server 2022
6. Extra features for both OS types:
   a. Error handling for invalid inputs(e.g. user does not exist, insufficient permissions)    
   b. While creating a user, it asks for set password automated or manually
      i. If automated, it asks for password length (minimum 8 characters) and generates a strong password and displays it.
      ii. If manually, it prompts for password input and validates its strength.
   c. Log all actions performed with timestamps to a log file for auditing purposes.
7. Ensure the script requires administrative privileges to run.
8. Provide clear instructions and prompts for user interaction.
